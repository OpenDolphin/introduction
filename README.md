## Introduction

We're trying to build the next social network with a community effort. We want to make the process, project and company
completely Open Source and driven by the community.  
  
Everyone should be able to have a saying in how the process should steer, and we'll decide together what's best for the project and
the company.

## Open Company

In the future, if the project takes off, we plan to become a
completely open and transparent company.

This means that, wherever possible, all the aspects of the company
(for example, the project discussions, the roadmaps, possible future features, salaries, architecture diagrams, ...) will be made public
with a reasonable license that will allow humanity to improve,
but will make it a bit difficult for companies to take our products
and not contribute back somehow.

We truly believe we can not only build a platform, but an entire company based on these values:

- Transparency
- Open
- Unbiased
- Community-driven

## Business Model

The long term of this project is to become useful _and_ profitable.  
We would like to retribute every contributor (even if not employed by the company), but to do that we obviously need money.  
  
Details about monetization of the project will follow (and will be decided together), but as a general guideline we plan to:

- respect the user's privacy
- not sell data without the user's consent
- be completely transparent on what we collect, how we process the data and where it ends up
- give full freedom to the user on the data they own, and where this is used
